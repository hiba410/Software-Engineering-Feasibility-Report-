# 🅿️ Park$mart – Mall Parking Management System

This repository contains the **Feasibility Study** for **Park$mart**, a proposed **Mall Parking Management System** designed to improve the parking experience for visitors through real-time monitoring of parking occupancy.  

---

## 📖 Abstract
The feasibility study presents a comprehensive analysis of a smart parking solution that aims to address the challenges faced by mall visitors, especially during peak hours.  
The system leverages **IoT sensors** to detect parking spot occupancy and a **centralized backend** for data processing. Visitors can access accurate and timely parking availability information via a **user-friendly mobile application**.  

The study evaluates **technical, operational, and economic feasibility**, analyzing the required technology stack, system architecture, cost, risks, and potential challenges. Alternative solutions are compared, with the **sensor-based approach** recommended due to its precision, scalability, and long-term benefits.  

The findings conclude that the proposed system is:
- ✅ Technically viable  
- ✅ Operationally beneficial  
- ✅ Economically justifiable  

Ultimately, Park$mart has the potential to **enhance visitor satisfaction, optimize parking space utilization, and provide mall management with valuable insights for better decision-making**.
